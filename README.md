# Compare-Sorting-Algorithms

A project that I made for an SRP in year 10 science.
It is riddled with bugs everywhere you look, esspecially the ui. It isnt optimized at all for dynamic screen sizes and ratios. 
All the algorithms work in the backend, a few of them fail visualising the sorting in certain cases.
